## Custom `EnvironmentPostProcessor` demo
This demo showcases how `EnvironmentPostProcessor` can be used to accommodate to advanced
use cases. It is based on a
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9902[feature request].

`MailEnvironmentPostProcessor` is looking for OS env variables with a given name and map
them to standard Spring Boot properties. If at least one is found a new `PropertySource`
is added _after_ the `systemEnvironment` one.

For instance, let's assume that the `ACME_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE` OS env variable is
set. Using the `/env` endpoint, it is quite easy to figure out what happened:

```json
"systemEnvironment": {
    "ACME_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE": "true",
  },
  "mailProperties": {
    "spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable": "true"
  },
  "applicationConfig: [classpath:/application.properties]": {
    "management.security.enabled": "false"
  }
```

Because the property sources are co-located, the usual precedence will work as it should (
i.e. a property set higher in the list will effective override the OS env property even
though their names don't match).
